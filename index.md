#### March 31, 2017

The Trusted Identities Group (TIG) has posted a Revised Draft of the parent document for Special Publication 800-63-3, Digital Identity Guidelines, whose **comment period closes May 1, 2017**. 

_This extended comment period is for the parent volume only; not sections A, B, or C._ (The original draft of the parent document and related sections were posted from January 30 - March 31, 2017).

Our [blog post](http://trustedidentities.blogs.govdelivery.com/2017/03/31/a-minor-plot-twist-comment-period-extended-for-part-of-sp-800-63-3/) provides details about this revised draft and the extended comment period.

The revised draft is available at <https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63-3.html> and in the PDF linked below. We encourage readers to provide comments during this open period. For maximum flexibility to our stakeholder community we are offering two methods to submit comments. The preferred method is to submit comments [here](https://github.com/usnistgov/800-63-3/issues). We've included [instructions](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/comment_help.html) to assist those that are new to this process. 

For those unable to provide comments online, a PDF and comment matrix is available [here](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsDrafts.html#800-63-3).  Please note, all comments submitted via email will be transposed to our online comment page so that we can manage comments in a single place. We will include organizational attribution when we post the comment(s) online.
